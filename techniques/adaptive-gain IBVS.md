when we apply IBVS for UAV landing, if the UAV decreases its altitute when its horizontal position is far from the center of the landing target, the features can get easily out of the image plane. 
So it is important to keep the features inside of the iamge plane as lone as possible. 

an adaptive IBVS gain, using the inverse tangent function where it was applied to the horizontal plane to reduce roll and pitch angle by lowering the velocity for x- and y-directions, and ensure that the feature stays in the FOV.
