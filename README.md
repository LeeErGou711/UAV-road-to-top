- follow this page to build VRX on my Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS melodic system.
  	- [VRX Classic Tutorials](https://github.com/osrf/vrx/wiki/VRX-Classic-Tutorials)
## 8.30
- follow these blogs to learn to make a UAV simulation in matlab
	- [Guyueju](https://www.guyuehome.com/8981)
	- [CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/m0_47737058/article/details/115737719)
-  follow the github package using the IBVS method for UAV landing in matlab
	- [QuadcopterVisualServoing](https://github.com/BillyTziv/QuadcopterVisualServoing)

## 8.31
- start to  follow this paper to reproduce the robust IBVS method for UAV landing on a static platform (based on the above IBVS program)
  	- [Robust Image-Based Landing Control of a Quadrotor on an Unpredictable Moving Vehicle Using Circle Features](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9791477)
  	- (read the source matlab code and try to understand the IBVS algorithm)
- learn YOLO and reproduce YOLO v5 to detect a symbol attached on a platform for UAV landing.
  	- [YOLO v5 official tutorial](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki)
	- [Train a specific model](https://blog.csdn.net/oJiWuXuan/article/details/107558286)
 	- [a useful tool for raw data processing](http://www.jinglingbiaozhu.com/)

## 9.1 a strong typhoon is approaching SZ :cyclone: :cyclone: :cyclone:
- collect photo data for the platform for UAV landing, and train the specific YOLO model
- continue to reproduce the robust IBVS method
