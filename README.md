# UAV-road-to-top
## 8.29
- follow this page to build VRX on my Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS melodic system.
  	- [VRX Classic Tutorials](https://github.com/osrf/vrx/wiki/VRX-Classic-Tutorials)
## 8.30
- follow these blogs to learn to make a UAV simulation in matlab
	- [Guyueju](https://www.guyuehome.com/8981)
	- [CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/m0_47737058/article/details/115737719)
-  follow the github package using the IBVS method for UAV landing in matlab
	- [QuadcopterVisualServoing](https://github.com/BillyTziv/QuadcopterVisualServoing)

## 8.31
- start to  follow this paper to reproduce the robust IBVS method for UAV landing on a static platform (based on the above IBVS program)
  	- [Robust Image-Based Landing Control of a Quadrotor on an Unpredictable Moving Vehicle Using Circle Features](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9791477)
  	- (read the source matlab code and try to understand the IBVS algorithm)
- learn YOLO and reproduce YOLO v5 to detect a symbol attached on a platform for UAV landing.
  	- [YOLO v5 official tutorial](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki)
	- [Train a specific model](https://blog.csdn.net/oJiWuXuan/article/details/107558286)
 	- [a useful tool for raw data processing](http://www.jinglingbiaozhu.com/)

## 9.1 (a strong typhoon is approaching SZ :cyclone: :cyclone: :cyclone:)
- collect photo data for the platform for UAV landing, and train the specific YOLO model on Google [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1H7_7Eba218TUUjTCgBzzS8VF5w8B88k5#scrollTo=X75x6SqI0hmb)
- continue to reproduce the robust IBVS method
## 9.2
- study the wiki of [Prometheus P450 autonomous tracking](https://github.com/amov-lab/prometheus_wiki/blob/main/doc/source/docs/p450/5-%E8%BF%9B%E9%98%B6%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD-%E5%AE%A4%E5%86%85%E8%87%AA%E4%B8%BB%E8%B7%9F%E8%B8%AA.rst) and use the above trained model to track the target landing platform

## 9.4 (new semester starts today :kissing_closed_eyes::kissing_closed_eyes::kissing_closed_eyes:)
- upload my trained model [here](https://github.com/LeeErGou711/yolov5/tree/master)
- see the main.ipynb to run it.
